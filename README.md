# Task 6: Password Strength Evaluation

## Objective:
Understand what makes a password strong and test it using online strength checker tools.

## Passwords Tested & Results:

| Password           | Strength Score | Feedback Summary                                 |
|--------------------|----------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| password123        | 20%            | Too common, no symbols or upper/lowercase mix    |
| JohnDoe@2023       | 60%            | Better, but name-based and predictable pattern   |
| T!m3To$h1n3&Gr0w!  | 100%           | Strong: length, mix of cases, symbols, numbers   |

## Tips Learned:
- Use at least 12 characters
- Include uppercase, lowercase, digits, and symbols
- Avoid using names, birthdays, or common words
- Try using passphrases (e.g., `Purple$Sky#Rains9!`)

## Common Password Attacks:

### 1. **Brute Force Attack:**
Tries all possible combinations. Long and complex passwords resist better.

### 2. **Dictionary Attack:**
Uses a list of common passwords and words. Avoid real words or patterns.

## Best Practices:
- Use a **password manager** to store complex passwords.
- Enable **multi-factor authentication (MFA)**.
- Regularly update your passwords.

## Conclusion:
Complexity and randomness significantly improve password strength. Using secure habits like MFA and password managers further enhances security.
